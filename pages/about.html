                <h2>The Story</h2>
                <p>Hi! I'm a 14-year-old Linux enthusiast who went from "What if I build a website?" to publishing this live site in just 4 days.</p>
                
                <p>This website was built to share Linux knowledge with anyone who wants to learn. Every guide here is written based on real experience, troubleshooting, and hands-on learning.</p>
            </section>

            <section>
                <h2>The Setup</h2>
                <div class="tech-stack">
                    <div class="tech-item">
                        🖥️ <span class="highlight">HCL ME Laptop - 14 years old</span> (same age as me!) - Rescued from being considered "too old," upgraded from Windows 7 32-bit → Windows 10 Pro → 64-bit → Dual-boot with Linux Mint. Together, we're proving age is just a number.
                    </div>
                    <div class="tech-item">
                        🤖 <span class="highlight">Claude AI</span> - My learning coach. Teaching me how to build things right, not just doing it for me.

                        💰 <span class="highlight">Total cost: Basically FREE</span> - Built with refurbished tech that others considered e-waste.

            <section>
                <h2>What This Proves</h2>
                <p>You don't need the latest hardware to learn, build, and create. You need curiosity, determination, and the willingness to figure things out.</p>
                
                <p>This entire website - from learning HTML and CSS to mastering Git and GitHub to publishing with HTTPS - was built on a 14-year-old laptop. If I can do this with hardware most people would throw away, you can do it with whatever you have.</p>
                
                <p>Age doesn't matter. Equipment doesn't matter. What matters is taking action.</p>

            <section>
                <h2>The Mission</h2>
                <p>My goal is simple: make Linux accessible and understandable for everyone. No gatekeeping, no assuming you already know things, just clear explanations that actually help.</p>
                
                <p>Every guide on this site is written to be beginner-friendly while still being useful for experienced users. I write the guides I wish I had when I was learning.</p>
            </section>

            <section>
                <h2>What's Next</h2>
                <p>This site will keep growing. I'm constantly learning new Linux commands, discovering useful tips, and finding better ways to do things. Every time I learn something worth sharing, I'll add a new guide.</p>
                
                <p>If you have suggestions for topics you'd like to see covered, feel free to share them. This site exists to help people learn.</p>

                <h2>Built With</h2>
                <p>This site is:</p>
